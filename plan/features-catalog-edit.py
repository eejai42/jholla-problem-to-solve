"""Bring the Features table up to date and enrich it with challenge provenance.

One coherent rule-change to effortless-rulebook.json. The Features table was ~30
commits stale (10 rows, only Title/Description). This:

  (1) Adds metadata fields to the schema:
        - Category        (raw)  : which layer of the platform this belongs to
        - Priority        (raw)  : Load-bearing | Supporting | Roadmap
        - ChallengeRefs   (raw)  : JSON array string of provenance objects, each
                                   {file,line,col,len,quote,section,relation} — the
                                   EXACT text + filename + line + char position the
                                   feature addresses, for UI hover tips.
        - ChallengeNotes  (raw)  : free-form Markdown comment: which challenge
                                   elements it relates to (direct/indirect) and how.
        - ChallengeRefsRendered (raw) : pre-flattened Markdown bullet list of the
                                   refs, so the dumb hbars template can just print it.
        - RefCount        (calc) : COUNTA-free count carried as raw int for display.
        - CatalogBlock    (calc) : one assembled Markdown block per feature for the
                                   PLATFORM_FEATURES.md template (header + meta line).

  (2) Refreshes the existing 10 rows with that metadata.

  (3) ADDS rows for capabilities that now exist but were never catalogued:
        keystone four-gate verdict, witnessed red/green harness, disease-state
        machine, derived SLEDAI activity, treatment-line recommendation,
        emergent serology-signature cluster, evidence/disease disagreement,
        cohort discovery board, in-app explainer DAG, URL-driven routing,
        reverse-sync DB->rulebook, honest coverage map.

Provenance offsets were resolved against THE-ORIGINAL-CHALLENGE.md and verified.
Idempotent (re-running replaces the Features table cleanly). ensure_ascii=False to
preserve literal em-dashes / en-dashes (file convention).
